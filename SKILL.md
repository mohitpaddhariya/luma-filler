# Lumate

Register the user for a Luma event: understand the event, fill standard fields from
a saved profile, draft grounded answers to open-ended questions, confirm, submit.
Only ask the user for what can't be answered from their profile + research.

## What you have

Three dependency-light helper scripts (all executable, bare paths so they word-split
in any shell):

```bash
PF=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/profile.py     # profile: route / persist-field / get / set / match / remember / forget / missing / show
RS=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/research.py    # research: github / summary / linkedin-set / enrich-profile
BR=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/browser.py     # browser: login / status / read / apply / fill / submit / cache-get
```

- **Browser** is self-contained **headless Playwright** (no gstack). Data: profile
  `~/.lumate/profile.json`, research cache `~/.lumate/research.json`,
  persistent login `~/.lumate/pw-profile/`, screenshots in `~/.lumate/`.
- **Gmail MCP** is connected — usable to read a Luma login code if one is required.

### Running the scripts (important)

- `$PF` and `$RS` are pure local/network Python — run them with the **normal Bash tool**.
- `$BR` launches **headless Chromium**, which the default Bash sandbox **kills**. Run
  every `$BR …` command with the **Bash sandbox disabled** (or, if that's unavailable,
  via the `!` shell-prefix in the user's shell). `browser.py` self-bootstraps into its
  venv, so plain `python3`/bare-path invocation is fine.

### How it gets faster (read this — it's the point)

The skill LEARNS. The first event for a given set of questions takes time; every event
after is fast and **question-free**:

- **Resolve before asking.** For each field, `$PF route "<label>"` (deterministic, for the
  finite recurring fields) → then `$PF match "<question>"` (fuzzy, for custom prose). If
  `known`/`matched`, USE the value — do NOT ask.
- **Persist every answer.** The instant the user gives ANY value (typed, dropdown/combo
  pick, checkbox, or an edited draft), store it before moving on:
  `$PF persist-field "<label>" "<value>"` (auto-routes to the right structured key, else
  `custom_answers`). Hard rule, not cleanup — it's why event 2 asks nothing.
- **One-shot fast path.** When the profile already covers a form, `$BR apply <url>
  answers.json [--submit]` does read+fill(+submit) in ONE browser launch (vs three).

## Setup (run first)

```bash
PF=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/profile.py
RS=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/research.py
BR=~/.claude/skills/lumate/scripts/browser.py

# One-time: Playwright client in a dedicated venv (system Python is PEP-668 managed).
# Chromium is reused from the shared cache — no large download.
~/.lumate/venv/bin/python -c "import playwright" 2>/dev/null || {
  python3 -m venv ~/.lumate/venv && ~/.lumate/venv/bin/pip install playwright
}

$PF init      # create profile.json if missing
$PF show      # see what's already known
$RS show      # see cached research (may be empty on first run)
```

If the user did not give a lu.ma URL, ask for it. Accept `lu.ma/xxxx`,
`https://lu.ma/xxxx`, `lu.ma/e/...`, `luma.com/xxxx`; `browser.py` normalizes it.

## Step 0 — First-run onboarding (only if the profile is bare)

Trigger when `$PF missing` lists `identity.full_name` **and** `$PF get about.bio` is
empty. Goal: capture a reusable profile once so every future event is fast.

1. Capture the basics, then auto-research GitHub. Take the user's name/email from the
   harness user context when available, otherwise ask; confirm their GitHub handle:
   ```bash
   $PF set identity.full_name "<the user's name>"
   $PF set identity.email "<the user's email>"
   $PF set professional.github "<their github handle>"   # confirm with the user
   $RS github                                              # fetch GitHub -> research.json
   $RS enrich-profile                                      # proposes about.*/professional.* (writes nothing)
   ```
2. Ask the user **one** `AskUserQuestion` batch that (a) confirms/edits the
   `enrich-profile` proposals (bio, headline, website, twitter, skills), and (b)
   collects what research can't know: **LinkedIn URL**, city/country, company (if any),
   a default `about.goals` ("why I usually attend events"), and dietary/pronouns if they
   want defaults. Everything optional except name/email.
3. Persist accepted values, e.g.:
   ```bash
   $PF set about.bio "..."; $PF set about.goals "..."; $PF set professional.city "..."
   $PF set professional.linkedin "https://www.linkedin.com/in/..."
   $RS linkedin-set --url "https://www.linkedin.com/in/..." --headline "..." --confidence high
   ```
Onboarding runs once; later events skip it.

## Step 1 — Auth (logged-in Luma session)

```bash
$BR status        # {"logged_in": true|false}   (sandbox-disabled)
```
If not logged in, run the one-time headed sign-in and tell the user a Chrome window
will open to log into Luma:
```bash
$BR login         # headed; waits up to 5 min for sign-in; persists the session
```
**Being logged in is the key to hands-off registration** — authenticated sessions
almost never get the Cloudflare "verify you are human" check that blocks *guest*
submits, so a logged-in `submit` typically goes straight through with no captcha and no
visible window. The hardened browser fingerprint (real Chrome UA, no `navigator.webdriver`
tell — set automatically in `launch()`) keeps that legit session from being false-flagged.
Always prefer being logged in. Guest registration (name+email, possibly an emailed code)
still works if the user declines to log in, but expect the captcha hand-off then.

## Step 2 — Read the event and form

```bash
$BR read "<url>"   # sandbox-disabled; prints JSON, saves ~/.lumate/last-form.png
```
The JSON has: `title`, `event_text` (for the brief), `button_label` + `button_kind`
(`proceed`/`paid`/`closed`), `form_opened`, `instant_registered`, and `fields[]`
(each: `tag`, `type`, `label`, `name`, `placeholder`, `maxlength`, `required`,
`options`). A `type:"combo"` field is a Luma lazy custom dropdown — its captured
`options[]` are the allowed values; resolve any answer to one of them (an empty
`options:[]` means a required live pick). Branch on `button_kind`:

| kind | meaning | action |
|---|---|---|
| `proceed` | free / approval | continue (form is opened and read) |
| `paid` | ticket/checkout/price | **STOP.** Do not auto-pay. Tell the user, confirm before any payment |
| `closed` | closed / waitlist / full | report; ask whether to join the waitlist |

If `instant_registered` is true (logged-in one-click), skip to Step 9's verification —
there are no fields. If `button_kind` is null/empty, the page may be 404 or already
registered — read `event_text` and report.

## Step 3 — Build an event brief (reasoning, no tool)

From `title` + `event_text` + `button_label`, write yourself a 4–6 line brief:
event name, host/org, **type** (hackathon / meetup / conference / workshop / founder
or networking dinner / demo day / AMA / other), audience, **what the host is screening
for**, and a **recommended tone** (hackathon → technical/direct; founder or networking
dinner → warm/personal; conference → professional; community meetup → friendly). If the
page is thin, you may `WebSearch` the host to understand the event. This brief drives
how open-ended answers are drafted.

## Step 4 — Load research

```bash
$RS github --max-age 168    # refetch GitHub only if cache is >7 days old
$RS linkedin-get            # reuse stored LinkedIn (url+headline) if present
$RS summary                 # compact, grounded text to feed into drafting
```
If a field needs LinkedIn and none is stored, use the URL from the profile/onboarding
(optionally `WebFetch` it for a headline). Never invent a LinkedIn profile.

## Step 5 — Map every field to a value

For each field in `fields[]`, resolve its value in this order — **resolve before asking**:

1. **Route (deterministic, recurring fields)** — `$PF route "<label>"` → `{key,value,known}`.
   If `known`, USE `value`. Covers name, email, **work email** (empty work_email → fall
   back to `identity.email`), phone, company, job title, LinkedIn, Twitter, GitHub,
   website, city, country, **product role**, **community**, **languages**, dietary,
   t-shirt, pronouns, and the marketing checkbox — no prose label-guessing for these.
   Router fallbacks: job title → first non-empty of `professional.{job_title,role}`,
   `about.headline`; "share a link to a project / your website" → first non-empty of
   `professional.website`, `$RS show` `top_repos[0].url`, `professional.linkedin`.
2. **Combos (`type:"combo"`)** — the value MUST be one of the field's `options[]`; resolve
   via route/match, then map the stored answer to the exact matching option string.
3. **Reusable custom answers** — `$PF match "<the question>"`; use `value` when `matched`.
4. **Open-ended / narrative questions** — route to Step 6 (drafting).
5. **Only fields that fail BOTH route and match** go into ONE `AskUserQuestion` batch
   (options for obvious choices; free text allowed). **Immediately `$PF persist-field
   "<label>" "<value>"` for every answer — including dropdown/combo and checkbox picks —**
   before filling. Already-known fields never enter the batch.

Run `$PF missing` to confirm required standard fields (`full_name`, `email`) are set.

## Step 6 — Draft answers to open-ended questions

**Which fields:** a field is open-ended if `type` is `textarea`, OR a text input with
`maxlength ≥ ~80` AND a label keyword match (build/built/working on/project/ship/made;
why attend|join|interested; tell us|about you|background|intro; goals|hoping to get|
experience|describe). NOT the link/social/standard fields already claimed in Step 5.

**Default = auto-fill one best draft** (the user chose low-friction). Ground it ONLY in
real facts: the event brief, `about.*`, and `$RS summary` / `top_repos` (verbatim
project names + descriptions). Match tone to the brief. Respect `maxlength` (keep the
draft under it). **Never fabricate** employers, titles, metrics, awards, or projects;
omit LinkedIn-derived claims if confidence is low.

**Surface 2–3 options (plan-mode style) only when UNSURE** — i.e. weak grounding (no
GitHub data and no relevant `about.*`), an ambiguous/unusual question, a
selective/high-stakes event (`Request to Join`, competitive hackathon) with multiple
valid angles, or the best draft overflows `maxlength`. Use one `AskUserQuestion` per such
field with the **full draft text in each option's description** (the preview), differing
by angle — **Builder** (leads with shipped projects), **Motivation/fit** (why this
event), **Concise** (1–2 sentences) — plus "Write my own / edit". Apply edits and
re-confirm the single revised draft.

**Required:** persist each final answer the instant it's settled — `$PF persist-field
"<question>" "<final answer>"`. Any question answered or drafted HERE this run means the
event does NOT qualify for the Step 8 fast path (new/drafted text must be human-confirmed).

## Step 7 — Fill the form

Build an `answers.json` (a JSON **list**) from your mapping, then fill (no submit):

```json
[
  {"match": {"name": "name"}, "action": "fill", "value": "Ada Lovelace"},
  {"match": {"name": "email"}, "action": "fill", "value": "you@example.com"},
  {"match": {"label": "What is your LinkedIn profile URL?"}, "action": "fill", "value": "https://linkedin.com/in/..."},
  {"match": {"label": "Idea(s) for the hackathon"}, "action": "fill", "value": "<drafted answer>"},
  {"match": {"label": "Are you currently in a product role?"}, "action": "combo", "value": "Yes"}
]
```
- `match`: prefer `name` when the field has one; else `label` (matched normalized, so the
  nbsp/`*` don't matter); `placeholder` or `text` as fallbacks.
- `action`: `fill` (text/email/url/textarea), `select` (native `<select>`), `combo` (Luma
  custom dropdown — `match` by `label`, `value` = an exact string from the field's
  `options[]`), `click` (radio/checkbox — match by the option `text`), `type` (only if
  `fill` doesn't register on a React input).

```bash
$BR apply "<url>" /path/answers.json   # PREFERRED: ONE launch — opens, fills, returns
                                       # applied/failed/missing_required (+ filled.png)
# $BR fill "<url>" /path/answers.json  # only if you want the separate fill step
```
Fix any `failed` (adjust the match) or `missing_required` (resolve via route/match, persist,
rebuild `answers.json`, re-run). Persist any non-standard pick not already saved
(`$PF persist-field "<label>" "<chosen option>"`). Look at `filled.png` to confirm. Never
invent values for required fields — if you can't determine one, stop and ask.

## Step 8 — Confirm, or fast-path (zero questions when everything is known)

**Persist-before-confirm (REQUIRED):** before any summary or submit, every value in
`answers.json` — each fill AND each select/combo/click/checkbox pick — must already be
saved (`$PF persist-field`/`set`). Run `$PF show` to verify; a value missing from the
profile after submit is a bug.

**Fast path — skip the blocking confirm and submit directly — ONLY when EVERY one holds:**
- every value came from saved data: each standard field via `$PF route`/`get` (non-empty),
  each custom/combo/checkbox via `$PF match` `matched:true` (a previously-remembered
  answer); AND
- nothing was AI-drafted this run (no Step 6 drafting — every open-ended question already
  had a stored answer); AND
- nothing was newly asked of the user this run (so a first-time event, which always asks
  something, naturally falls to the confirm path — even "Request to Join" ones); AND
- `apply`/`fill` returned `failed: []` and `missing_required: []`; AND
- `button_kind` is `proceed` (never `paid` — paid always stops in Step 2).

When all hold: print one line ("Registering you for **<title>** (<date>) from your saved
profile — submitting now"), submit, and report after (Step 10 is the record). This is the
hands-off repeat case the user wants.

**Otherwise the blocking confirm is REQUIRED:** show event title + date + **every** value
(drafted answers in full) → `AskUserQuestion` Submit / Cancel / Edit, even if the user said
"just do it"; on Edit, change `answers.json` and re-confirm. When unsure whether a value is
"fresh," treat it as fresh and confirm.

## Step 9 — Submit and verify

```bash
$BR apply "<url>" /path/answers.json --submit   # PREFERRED: one launch — read+fill+submit
# $BR submit "<url>" /path/answers.json          # equivalent two-step (fill already done)
```
`apply --submit` refuses (`submitted:false` + `reason`) if any required field is uncovered
or failed — trust that guard; resolve, persist, rebuild, and retry. Both return
`submitted`, `submit_button`, `success`, `captcha`, and `result_text`
(+ `result.png`). Confirm real success from `result_text`/the screenshot — don't assume.
Look for "You're In", "Registered", "Request received / pending approval", a ticket/QR, or
a calendar add. If `success` is false or you see validation errors, fix the named fields
and re-submit. If it's "pending approval", report the host must approve. **If `captcha` is
true** (Cloudflare "verify you are human" / hCaptcha), the submit is bot-blocked — stop,
don't try to solve it, and hand off so the user finishes in a visible browser (the form is
already filled, so a headed run pre-fills it for a one-click finish). This mostly happens
for *guest* submits — being logged in (Step 1) usually prevents the challenge entirely.
Never build a captcha solver or auto-defeat the challenge; logging in is the legitimate fix.

## Step 10 — Persist what you learned

```bash
$PF show     # confirm profile reflects the answers you saved as you went
```
Mirror only durable identity/`about`/recurring fields (name, company, work email, job
title, socials, city/country, product role, community, languages, marketing opt-in, bio)
into Claude's memory store — NOT `research.json` (a cache) or event-specific custom answers.
Update `~/.claude/projects/<your-project>/memory/lumate-profile.md` (and a one-line
pointer in that folder's `MEMORY.md`), keeping `~/.lumate/profile.json` as the source
of truth.

## Auth details & edge cases

- **Email code:** if Luma emails a 6-digit/short code, read it via the Gmail MCP (recent
  `lu.ma`/`luma.com` mail with "code"/"sign in"), then `$BR fill` the code field and submit.
- **Already registered:** if the page shows the user is going/registered, report and stop.
- **Paid events:** never enter payment or complete a paid checkout without explicit
  per-event confirmation. Stop at the price/checkout step.
- **Approval-required:** submitting creates a pending request; say so.
- **Closed / full:** report; offer the waitlist if present.
- **Multi-step forms / "+1" guests:** handle one screen at a time; ask about guest count
  if prompted. Re-run `$BR read`/`fill` after advancing.
- **Bot / captcha wall:** if Luma blocks the headless browser, tell the user and suggest
  finishing in their own browser; don't try to defeat a captcha.

## Completion report

End with: event name, outcome (Registered / Pending approval / Waitlisted / Blocked),
which fields were auto-filled vs drafted vs asked, and where the confirmation screenshot
was saved (`~/.lumate/result.png`). If anything is uncertain, say so plainly rather
than claiming success.
